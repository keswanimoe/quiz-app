An interactive quiz app created as part of FDM's She Lives Tech Coding Bootcamp in March 2023.

This was created with CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/quiz-app-tlh8yr

It was my first time programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To get the quiz questions and answers we were directed to this website 

https://opentdb.com/ 

and I implemented this particular database to get the quiz app up and running!
